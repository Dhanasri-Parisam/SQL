1. Creating a Database
CREATE DATABASE my_database;
Purpose: This command creates a new database named my_database. A database is a structured collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.
2. Using a Database


USE my_database;
Purpose: This command selects the my_database for use. After executing this command, all subsequent SQL commands will be executed within this database context.

3. Creating a Table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    grade CHAR(1)
);

Purpose: This command creates a new table named students with four columns:
id: An integer that serves as the primary key, uniquely identifying each student.
name: A variable character string (up to 50 characters) to store the student's name.
age: An integer to store the student's age.
grade: A single character to represent the student's grade (e.g., A, B, C).

4. Inserting Data
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, grade)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20, 'A');
Purpose: This command inserts a new record into the students table with the specified values for each column. In this case, it adds a student with ID 1, name "John Doe", age 20, and grade 'A'.


5. Retrieving Data
Select all columns:
SELECT * FROM students;
Purpose: This command retrieves all columns and rows from the students table.
Select specific columns:
SELECT name, age FROM students;
Purpose: This command retrieves only the name and age columns from the students table.


6. Filtering Data (WHERE Clause)
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 18;
Purpose: This command retrieves all columns for students whose age is greater than 18. The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on specified conditions.


7. Updating Data
UPDATE students 
SET grade = 'B' 
WHERE id = 1;
Purpose: This command updates the grade of the student with id 1 to 'B'. The SET clause specifies the new value, and the WHERE clause identifies which record to update.


8. Deleting Data
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1;
Purpose: This command deletes the record of the student with id 1 from the students table. The WHERE clause ensures that only the specified record is removed.


9. Sorting Data (ORDER BY)
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;
Purpose: This command retrieves all columns from the students table and sorts the results by the age column in descending order (from oldest to youngest).


10. Limiting Results (LIMIT)
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 5;
Purpose: This command retrieves the first 5 records from the students table. The LIMIT clause is useful for pagination or when you only want a subset of results.


11. Aggregate Functions
Count students:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;
Purpose: This command counts the total number of records (students) in the students table.
Find the average age:
SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;
Purpose: This command calculates the average age of all students in the students table.


12. Grouping Data (GROUP BY & HAVING)
SELECT grade, COUNT(*) 
FROM students 
GROUP BY grade 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
Purpose: This command groups the records by the grade column and counts how many students are in each grade. The HAVING clause filters the results to only include grades with more than 2 students.


13. Joining Tables (INNER JOIN)
SELECT students.name, courses.course_name
FROM students
INNER JOIN courses ON students.id = courses.student_id;
Purpose: This command retrieves the names of students along with the names of the courses they are enrolled in. It uses an INNER JOIN to combine records from the students and courses tables based on the matching id from the students table and student_id from the courses table.


14. Creating an Index
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON students(name);
Purpose: This command creates an index on the name column of the students table. Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table, especially for large datasets.


15. Dropping a Table
DROP TABLE students;
Purpose: This command deletes the students table and all of its data from the database. This action is irreversible, so it should be used with caution.
