Understanding DBMS vs. RDBMS
1. Definition
DBMS (Database Management System): A system that helps store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System): A type of DBMS that stores data in a structured, table-based format with relationships between tables.

2. Data Storage
DBMS: Stores data in files or hierarchical structures.

RDBMS: Stores data in tables with rows & columns (relations).

3. Data Relationship
DBMS: No strict relationships between data.

RDBMS: Maintains relationships using primary and foreign keys.

4. Data Integrity
DBMS: No strict integrity constraints.

RDBMS: Enforces constraints like Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Not Null to maintain integrity.

5. ACID Compliance
DBMS: May not fully support ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

RDBMS: Strictly follows ACID properties for reliable transactions.

6. Scalability
DBMS: Suitable for small datasets, not optimized for large-scale data.

RDBMS: Efficient for handling large datasets with complex queries.

7. Examples
DBMS: File System, XML, Microsoft Access

RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MariaDB
