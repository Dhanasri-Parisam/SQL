Relational (SQL) vs. Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases
1. Structure
SQL: Table-based (rows & columns)

NoSQL: Flexible (key-value, document, graph, column)

2. Schema
SQL: Fixed schema (predefined structure)

NoSQL: Dynamic schema (can change easily)

3. Scalability
SQL: Vertical (scale up by adding more power to a single server)

NoSQL: Horizontal (scale out by adding more servers)

4. ACID Compliance
SQL: Strict (ensures data consistency: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

NoSQL: Relaxed (focuses on speed and availability, follows BASE: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent)

5. Performance
SQL: Good for complex queries, supports JOIN operations

NoSQL: Faster for large-scale read/write operations, better for big data

6. Best For
SQL: Structured data, complex queries (e.g., banking, finance, ERP, CRM)

NoSQL: Unstructured/semi-structured data, real-time apps (e.g., social media, IoT, big data)

7. Examples
SQL: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MariaDB

NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB, Firebase, Neo4j
